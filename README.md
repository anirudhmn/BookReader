# epubReader

This is an epub parsing system with two parts, one on a laptop and the other on a phone.

This app will allow you to easily read .epub files on your laptop while controlling when to flip the pages with your phone. Add books on your laptop by clicking the plus sign and selecting your epub file. The app will copy the file into the app's own directory so you can delete it afterwords. Not all epub files work (mac catalyst doesn't work perfectly) so if it doesn't work delete it and try another epub file. Press the Extract Text button to start reading. Open the app on your phone and select the same book to setup your remote. To flip the pages on your laptop, simply swipe left or right on your phone. If you want to skip to a specific page, press the current page number on your phone and enter a page number to flip to.


If you want to read a PDF, simply convert the pdf to a epub file using a website like [this](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-epub/)
