# BookReader

This is an file reading system with two parts, one on a laptop/ipad and the other on a phone. This app will allow you to easily read .epub or .pdf files on your laptop while controlling when to flip the pages with your phone. 

On the initial openining of the app, you will be prompted to pair your devices. The app on the laptop/ipad will give you a code; enter that code in the iphone app.

Add books on your laptop/ipad by clicking the plus sign and selecting your file. The app will copy the file into the app's own directory so you can delete it afterwords. Not all epub files work (mac catalyst doesn't work perfectly) so if it doesn't work delete it and try another epub file.

Press the Extract Text button on your laptop/ipad to start reading. Open the app on your phone and select the same book. To flip the pages on your laptop/ipad, simply swipe left or right on your phone (you can also swipe directly on the laptop/iphone if you want).

If you want to skip to a specific page, press the current page number on your phone and enter a page number to flip to.
