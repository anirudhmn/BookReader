# epubReader

This is an epub parsing system with two parts, one ideally on a laptop and the other on a phone.

Easily read .epub files on your laptop while controlling when to flip the pages with you phone. Select the Book option on the mac and scroll your your book library and select a book to read. Select the Remote option on the phone and select the same book. Swipe left or right on your phone to flip pages.

To add more books, simply click the plus sign on the mac and select your epub file. Not all epub files work (mac catalyst doesn't work perfectly) so if it doesn't work ignore it and try another book. 

If you want to read a PDF, simply convert the pdf to a epub file using a website like [this] (https://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-epub/).
